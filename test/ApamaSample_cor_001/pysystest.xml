    <title>Monitorscript injection and execution, sending events from process stdin</title>    
    <purpose><![CDATA[
Demonstrates sending events into a Correlator with a loaded monitorscript application by 
writing to the stdin of an engine_send process started in the background. This shows how 
events can be sent to the Correlator directly within the testcase class as opposed to 
sending via an event file.
